# Git Releaser

* Helps You correctly enumerate your project releases with simple terminal tool
* Automatically marks release commit with correct **tag**
* Automagically do everything for You ;)  **Just Try It**

```bash
$ ./git-releaser.sh
Branch [develop] exists.
Branch [master] exists.
We are on DEVELOP branch [develop]
-------------------------------------
Current Version: 1.2.0
-------------------------------------
Please select Your release number:
 * [1] - Major - 2.0.0
 * [2] - Minor - 1.3.0
 * [3] - Patch - 1.2.1
-------------------------------------
[1],[2],[3]:
```

## Installation

In Your project, root folder, execute command:

```bash
wget -O - https://gitlab.com/felixd/git-releaser/install/release.sh | bash
```

For security reasons check [release.sh](https://gitlab.com/felixd/git-releaser/install/release.sh) file before executing command.

Command will:
* Create `release.sh` file in your project folder which will be used for releases
* Create `VERSION` file if it does not exist with initial 0.0.0 version number
* Create `git-release/` folder + add it to `.gitignore` (You don't need it in Your project, `release.sh` will always check if it's there for You)

## Git branches names

`You are always doing releases from $DEVELOP_BRANCH`

```bash
DEVELOP_BRANCH = "develop"
MASTER_BRANCH  = "master"
RELEASE_PREFIX = "release/"
```
